# Smart Water System
City administrators need to keep a close eye on water supply, consumption, and equipment. With IoT, the whole water supply chain can become more transparent and easier to control.

With the help of sensors, a smart city water management system can enable you to collect real-time data—information that helps you visualize water distribution across the network. Residents with smart meters can make more informed decisions as a result, leading to a more sustainable city overall.

Water waste and disrupted water supply chains are a drain on the city’s budget. IoT can help you watch the health of water equipment and detect problems, like leaks in pipes. This allows operators to receive alerts and start fixing issues immediately. In the meantime, AI predictions allow you to nip problems in the bud by preventing failures before they cause severe incidents. With AI, city administrators can also watch the watershed and predict which areas are likely to flood, information that will help local authorities warn residents, manage traffic, and keep the city on its feet.
